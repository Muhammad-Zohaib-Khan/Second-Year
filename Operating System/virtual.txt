Silberschatz et al. exercise 10.3 A certain computer provides its users with a virtual-memory space
of 2
32 bytes. The computer has 2
18 bytes of physical memory. The virtual memory is implemented by
paging, and the page size is 4096 bytes. A user process generates the virtual address 11123456. Explain
how the system establishes the corresponding physical location. Distinguish between software and hardware
operations.
The virtual address in binary form is 0001 0001 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110. Since the page size is 2
12
,
the page table size is 2
20
. Therefore the low-order 12 bits 0100 0101 0110 are used as the offset into the
page, while the remaining 20 bits 0001 0001 0001 0010 0011 are used as the offset into the page table. The
page table entry provides the 6-bit frame number, which is combined with the 12-bit offset
